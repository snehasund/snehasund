<h2> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sneha Sundar.</h2>

I'm a statistics & computer science major at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign currently taking classes in computer systems, linear algebra, statistics and probability, and data science. I'm currently working as a Course Assistant for Data Science Discovery and as a developer for the Association of Computing Machinery's Infrastructure Team on their resume-book project. 

ðŸ’¡ I'm super passionate about exploring the realms of deep learning, artificial intelligence, and crafting impactful data visualizations. I'm always trying to delve deeper into understanding complex algorithms, enhancing predictive models, and finding innovative ways to present insights from data.

ðŸš€ In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a collection of projects that reflect my interests and skills. From machine learning implementations to data analysis projects, each repository showcases my dedication to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Feel free to explore and delve into the code!
