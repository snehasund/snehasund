🎀 My name is Sneha Sundar, and I'm a statistics & computer science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I'm super passionate about all things data science and machine learning!

☁️ I am currently a developer on the resume book project for the Association for Computing Machinery's Infrastructure Team as well as a Course Aide for Data Science Discovery (STAT/CS/IS 107). 

🧸 All my current / future personal projects will be uploaded to this Gitbhub page. In the meantime, feel free to contact me via my portfolio website (https://snehasund.github.io/snehasundar.io/) or my linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sneha-sundar26)!
